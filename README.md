## Description

This package provides TypeScript type definitions for the WordPress Customize Browser API (`@wordpress/customize-browser`), which is part of the WordPress Customizer interface. These type definitions enable TypeScript developers to work with the WordPress Customizer API with proper type checking and autocompletion.

The WordPress Customizer API allows developers to create custom controls, sections, and panels in the WordPress Customizer interface, as well as interact with the preview iframe.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// Access the customize object
const customize = wp.customize;

// Create a new setting
customize.create("my_setting", "default value", {
	id: "my_setting",
});

// Get a setting
const setting = customize("my_setting");
if (setting) {
	// Update the setting value
	setting.set("new value");
}
```

### Working with the Preview

```typescript
// In the preview iframe
wp.customize.preview.bind("ready", function () {
	// The preview is ready
	console.log("Preview is ready");
});

// Bind to custom events
wp.customize.preview.bind("custom_event", function (data) {
	// Handle the custom event
	console.log("Custom event received:", data);
});

// With multiple arguments
wp.customize.preview.bind("complex_event", function (data, moreData) {
	console.log("Received data:", data, moreData);
});
```
