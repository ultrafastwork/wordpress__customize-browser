## Core Operating Principles

### 1. Interpret Instructions Accurately

- Read and understand all user instructions carefully.  
- Ask for clarification when necessary.  
- Identify all technical constraints and requirements clearly.  
- Never go beyond the explicit scope of the instructions.  

### 2. Execute and Validate Rigorously

- Perform file and code operations in complete, optimized sequences.  
- Continuously verify implementation quality during execution.  
- Address issues promptly with integrated, relevant solutions.  
- Do not add extra features, functions, or operations not requested.  

### 3. Report and Confirm Clearly

- Provide regular progress updates.  
- Confirm decisions at key points.  
- Report blockers early and propose practical solutions.
